Day 3 - Begineer - Control Flow and Logical Operator

27. Control Flow with if / else and Conditional Operators
==>

syntax:
=======
if condition:
  statement
else:
  statement
  
Eg:
===
1.
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

if height > 120:
  print("You can ride the roller coster!")
else:
  print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride!")
  


2.
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

if height >= 120:
  print("You can ride the roller coster!")
else:
  print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride!")
  
  
  

Comparison Operators
=====================
Operator	Meaning
   >		Greater than
   >		less than
   >= 		Greater than equal to
   >=		Less than equal to 
   ==		Equal to
   =!		Not Equal to
   




28. [Interactive Coding Exercise] odd or even? Introducting the Modulo

Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
e.g. 86 is even because 86 รท 2 = 43
43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.
e.g. 59 is odd because 59 รท 2 = 29.5
29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.
The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division. 
==>

number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
if number % 2 == 0:
  print("This is an Even Number")
else:
  print("This is an odd Number")
  



29. Nested if statement and elif statements
==>
syntax:
Nested if / else
----------------
if condition:
  if another condition:
	do this
  else:
	do this
else:
  do this:
--------------------

Eg:

print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

if height >= 120:
  print("You can ride the roller coster!")
  age = int(input("What is your age?"))
  if age <= 18:
    print("please pay $7")
  else:
    print("please pay $12")
else:
  print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride!")
  


Syntax:
if / elif / else
-----------------
if condition1:
	do A
elif condition:
	do B
else:
	do this
-----------------

Eg:
---
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

if height >= 120:
  print("You can ride the roller coster!")
  age = int(input("What is your age?"))
  if age < 12:
    print("please pay $5")
  elif age <= 18:
    print("please pay $7")
  else:
    print("please pay $12")
else:
  print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride!")




32. Multiple If Statements in Succession 

syntax:
---------
Multiple if
------------
if condition1:
	do this
if condition2:
	do this
if condition3:
	do this

----------------

Eg:
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

if height >= 120:
  print("You can ride the roller coster!")
  age = int(input("What is your age?"))
  if age <= 12:
    bill = 5  
    print("Child ticket are $5")
  elif age <= 18:
    bill = 7
    print("Youth ticket are $7")
  else:
    bill = 12
    print("Adult ticket are $12")
  want_photo = input("Do you want a photo taken? Y or N. ")
  if (want_photo == 'Y') or (want_photo == 'y'):
      bill += 3 
  print(f"Your final bill is ${bill}")
else:
  print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride!")




34. Logical Operator 
--------------------

A and B   # both have to be true then only its TRUE, if one of thing fail or both fail then its consider as FAIL
c or D    # if one of condition true its evaluate as TRUE, if both false then only it evaluate as FALSE
not E	  # if condiition is true it become false , if condition is false it become true

Eg:
---

print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))
bill = 0

if height >= 120:
  print("You can ride the rollercoaster!")
  age = int(input("What is your age? "))
  if age < 12:
    bill = 5
    print("Child tickets are $5.")
  elif age <= 18:
    bill = 7
    print("Youth tickets are $7.")
  elif age >= 45 and age <= 55:
    print("Everything is going to be ok. Have a free ride on us!")
  else:
    bill = 12
    print("Adult tickets are $12.")
  
  wants_photo = input("Do you want a photo taken? Y or N. ")
  if wants_photo == "Y":
    bill += 3
  
  print(f"Your final bill is ${bill}")

else:
  print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
