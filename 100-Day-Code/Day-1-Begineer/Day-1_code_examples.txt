Day-1_code_examples:
=====================

5. Printing to the console in Python
==>
print("Hello World!")


6. Printing
==>
print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")



7. String Manipulation and and Code Intelligence
==>
print("Hello World!\nHello World!")    #\n adds new line

print("Hello" + " " + "Vivek")         #space between 2 seprated string


8.[Interactive coding Exercise] Debugging Practice
==>
Example Output
When you run your program, it should print the following:

challenge:
==========
Day 1 - String Manipulation
String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n.

code:
=====
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")



9. The Python input function
==>

#input() will get user input in console
#Then print() will print the word "hello" and the user input
print("Hello " + input("What is your Name?\n") + "!")




10. [Interactive Coding Exercise] Input Function
==>

Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. 
You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.

e.g.
https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+the+length+of+a+string+in+python+stack+overflow
Warning. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.


ANS:
#This code prints the number of characters in a user's name.
print( len( input("What is your name? ") ) )


#Notes
#If input was "Jack"
#1st: print(len("Jack"))
#2nd: print(4)



11. Python Variables
==>

name = "Jack"
print(name)

name = "Angela"
print(name)


name = input("What is your name?")
length = len(name)
print(length)



12.[ Interactive Coding Exercise ] Variables
Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b. 
==>
ANS:


a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")

c = a
a = b
b = c

print("a: " + a)
print("b: " + b)



14. Day 1 Project: Band Name Generator
==>

#Band-name-generator
#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator")
#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city_name = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in?\n")
#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet_name = input("What's your pet's name?\n")
#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your Band name could be " + city_name + " " + pet_name)
