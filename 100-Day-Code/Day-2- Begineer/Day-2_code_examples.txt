Day 2 - Begineer - Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

17. Python Primitive Data Types
==>
#Data Types

#String
print("Hello"[0]) # it will print first character
print("123" + "345") # it will concatenate two strings

#Integer
print(123 + 456) # it will print addition of two numbers
123_456_789   #it ignores _ and assume the number is 123456789

#Float
3.14159


#boolean
True
False



18. Type Error, Type Checking and Type Conversion
==>
num_char = len(input("What is your name?"))
new_num_char = str(num_char)
print("Your name has " + new_num_char + " characters.")

a = 5
print(type(a))

a = str(5)
print(type(a))

a = float(5)
print(type(a))


print(70 + float("70.5"))
print(str(70) + str(789))



19.[Interactive coding exercise] Data Types
Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
==>

two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")
#Check the data type of two_digit_number
print(type(two_digit_number))

#Get the first and second digits using subscripting then convert string to int.
first_digit = int(two_digit_number[0])
second_digit = int(two_digit_number[1])

#Add the two digits togeter
two_digit_number = first_digit + second_digit

print(two_digit_number)



20. Mathematicl Operations in Python
==>
1 + 3 #addition
3 - 2 #substraction
6 / 2 #division
3 * 2 #multiplication
2 ** 3 # Exponential


PEMDASLR
()
**
* /
+ - 




21. [Interactive Coding Exercise] BMI Calculator

Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, 
the short person is usually more overweight.
The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
==>
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")

weight_as_int = int(weight)
height_as_float = float(height)

# Using the exponent operator **
bmi = weight_as_int / height_as_float ** 2
# or using multiplication and PEMDAS
bmi = weight_as_int / (height_as_float * height_as_float)

bmi_as_int = int(bmi)

print(bmi_as_int)


22. Number Manipulation and F strings in Python
==>

print(rount(8 / 3, 2)) #It will round up upto 2 decimal places

print (8 // 3)  # Flow division it will it will convert into ineger



f stsring
=========
score = 0
height = 1.2
isWinning = True
#f-String
print(f"Your score is {score}, your height is {height}, your winning is {isWinning}")




23. [Interactive Coding Exercise] Life in Weeks
Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
    You have x days, y weeks, and z months left. 
Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops. 

==>

age = input("What is your current age? ")

years = 90 - int(age)
months = round(years * 12)
weeks = round(years * 52)
days = round(years * 365)

print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
